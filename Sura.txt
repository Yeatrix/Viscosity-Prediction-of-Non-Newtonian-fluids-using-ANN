R1
-two types of fluids
-non-newtonian in which high speed impact causes drastic change in viscosity and this property is utilised in ballistic textiles.
-thats why its necessary to know its behaviour under different conditions first hand to prevent future failure.
-models are there but none are capable enough to accurately understand the beahviour of discontinuous STF
-preparation of fluid,analysis (rheological),methodolgy of model development

things to know-possible improvements , what was accuarcy, objective,diff routes opened to me,experimental work to be done, expected time roughly,what were the challenges and shortcomings , how did they got to the equation.
